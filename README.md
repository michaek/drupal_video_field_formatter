# Drupal Video Field Formatter

A simple module that contains a formatter for video in standard Drupal fields: link and file. You set up the field, add a URL (for a link field) or upload a video file (for a file field) and choose a video formatter in the field display options. Currently, the only option provided is a formatter that uses the jwPlayer.

It can be downloaded at http://www.longtailvideo.com/wp/jwplayer.zip - put it in your libraries folder, as described on the Libraries module page http://drupal.org/project/libraries. Naturally, the Libraries module is a dependency of this module!

Provider plugins are implemented as CTools plugins, so the CTools module is a dependency of this module.
